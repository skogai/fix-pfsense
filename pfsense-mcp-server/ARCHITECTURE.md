# Architecture

How the pfSense MCP Server is put together, for contributors and reviewers.

## Overview

The server exposes 333 tools over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
that translate natural-language intent into calls against the
[pfSense REST API v2](https://github.com/pfrest/pfSense-pkg-RESTAPI). It is a
single-process, single-firewall server driven by a trusted operator; it holds no
per-request session state.

## Modules

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/main.py` | CLI/entry point; transport selection (stdio / streamable-http); `MCP_READ_ONLY` tool filtering; `MCP_API_KEY` validation. |
| `src/server.py` | The `FastMCP` instance and the lazily-constructed global API client; `VERSION` (single source of truth). |
| `src/tools/*.py` | 34 modules of `@mcp.tool` functions, grouped by pfSense subsystem. Each maps tool arguments to the REST API wire format. |
| `src/guardrails.py` | Risk classification, the `@guarded` / `@rate_limited` decorators, input screening, rate limiting, audit logging, secret redaction, rollback capture. |
| `src/client.py` | HTTP client: auth headers (API key / basic / JWT), query + control-param assembly, retry/backoff, connection pooling, and typed CRUD helpers. |
| `src/middleware.py` | ASGI bearer-token + Origin validation for HTTP transport, plus the unauthenticated `/health` probe. |
| `src/helpers.py` | Positive input validation (IP/port/MAC/CIDR/FQDN), pagination, sanitization, sort helpers. |
| `src/models.py` | `QueryFilter`, `SortOptions`, `PaginationOptions`, `ControlParameters`, and the `PfSenseVersion` enum. |

## Request lifecycle

1. A tool receives typed arguments and builds the REST payload with the exact
   upstream field names/types.
2. If decorated, the guardrail wrapper runs: allowlist → sanitize → rate-limit →
   (for `@guarded`) confirm/dry-run gate → capture a pre-change config revision
   for HIGH/CRITICAL ops.
3. The tool calls a `client.crud_*` / `_make_request` helper.
4. The client attaches auth, merges control params into the JSON body (pfSense
   reads `apply`/`placement`/… from the body, not the query string), and sends
   the request — retrying transient failures (connection errors and `429`;
   read-timeouts and `502`/`503`/`504` for idempotent GETs only) with bounded,
   jittered exponential backoff and a per-request total delay budget. Writes
   are never retried on an ambiguous response.
5. On `>= 400`, the error body is redacted and surfaced; on success the JSON is
   returned. `@guarded` tools attach a `config_backup` block (or a
   `config_backup_warning` if no rollback point could be captured) and an audit
   entry with redacted parameters.

## Guardrails

Risk is classified by tool-name prefix in `src/guardrails.py` (READ / LOW /
MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL). Two decorators enforce it:

- `@guarded` — HIGH/CRITICAL destructive tools; requires `confirm=True`,
  supports `dry_run`, captures a rollback point, and audits.
- `@rate_limited` — other mutating tools; rate-limits, sanitizes, allowlist-
  checks, and audits without requiring confirmation.

Coverage is enforced at import by `tests/test_guardrail_coverage.py`: every
non-READ tool must carry one of these decorators (they set a `_guardrail`
marker), and every HIGH/CRITICAL tool must be `@guarded`. A forgotten decorator
is a failing test, not a silent hole.

`MCP_READ_ONLY=true` removes every non-READ tool at startup; `MCP_ALLOWED_TOOLS`
restricts to a named allowlist.

## Wire-contract test layer

pfSense's REST framework **silently ignores unknown request keys** and
**strictly type-checks known ones**, so a misnamed or mistyped field is either a
no-op that reports success (PATCH) or a hard 400 (POST) — invisible to a mocked
unit test. To make that failure mode visible:

- `scripts/generate_contract.py` distills the upstream OpenAPI spec (a
  pkg-RESTAPI release asset) into a slim, vendored contract
  (`tests/contract/contract-v2.10.0.json`): valid field names, JSON types, enum
  choices, and create-required fields per endpoint.
- `tests/contract/schema.py` exposes `assert_payload_valid(mock)` which captures
  a tool's actual `_make_request` payload and checks it against the contract.

Regenerate for a new pkg-RESTAPI version:

```bash
gh release download <tag> --repo pfrest/pfSense-pkg-RESTAPI --pattern openapi.json
python scripts/generate_contract.py openapi.json tests/contract/contract-<ver>.json --version <ver>
```

## Protocol-level E2E layer

The unit and contract suites run in-process with the transport mocked away, so
they cannot see handshake, transport, or auth regressions. A third layer
(`scripts/inspector_smoke.sh`, CI job `mcp-inspector-e2e`) drives the built
server over the real MCP wire protocol with the official MCP Inspector CLI:
initialize handshake, tools/list with annotations on both transports, the
confirm gate on a destructive call, `MCP_READ_ONLY` reduction, `/health`, and
bearer-auth + Origin enforcement. It points the server at a black-holed
TEST-NET address, which is also what keeps the startup path honest: the
preflight connectivity check is hard-bounded (5 s) so an unreachable pfSense
can never stall the MCP handshake past a client's startup timeout.

## Version compatibility

`PfSenseVersion` (`src/models.py`) enumerates supported releases; the value is
informational (it does not gate behavior today). The wire layer targets
pkg-RESTAPI **v2.10.0**. See the README compatibility matrix; legacy names such as
the historically-mislabeled `CE_26_03` remain accepted as enum aliases.

## MCP protocol

The server speaks MCP **2025-11-25** (via FastMCP 3.4.x) and negotiates down per
connection. The **2026-07-28** revision removes the handshake and sessions
outright (every request self-contained) and formalizes a feature lifecycle with
a minimum twelve-month deprecation window. This server uses none of the
features that revision deprecates (Roots, Sampling, MCP Logging) and holds no
session state, so it already passes its suite and the Inspector wire-protocol
smoke test on the FastMCP 4 beta (a non-blocking CI job) — adopting the
stateless protocol once fastmcp 4 leaves beta is a dependency-pin change.

## Known limitations

Single global API client (no multi-instance yet); errors are string-typed rather
than a typed hierarchy; the package is still named `src` (PyPI rename pending).
These and other items are tracked in `RELEASE_AUDIT.md`.
