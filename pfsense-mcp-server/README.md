You:     Block all traffic from 203.0.113.5 on WAN
Claude:  ✓ created block rule  →  ✓ applied changes  →  rollback: restore_config_backup(revision_id=42)

You:     Why can't 192.168.1.50 reach the internet?
Claude:  ran diagnostics → gateway WAN_DHCP is down, and a block rule on LAN matches this host

You:     Add a WireGuard peer for my laptop and show me the config
Claude:  ✓ created peer on tun_wg0  →  here's the client config to import
```

**pfSense MCP Server** connects [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), and any other [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) client to your pfSense firewall. Ask questions, diagnose issues, and change configuration through conversation — with a confirmation gate, config backup, and rollback on every destructive action.

Letting an AI touch a production firewall is only safe if the plumbing is right, so that's where the work went: every tool's wire format is verified against the pfSense REST API schema by a contract-test layer, and every change runs through a guardrail pipeline. 572 tests plus a wire-protocol E2E suite in CI on Python 3.11–3.13.

## Why This Exists

Managing a pfSense firewall means clicking through web UI tabs, remembering field names, and hoping you don't fat-finger a rule that locks you out. With this MCP server, you describe what you want in plain English and the AI handles the REST API calls, validates inputs, and warns you before anything destructive happens.

**What makes it different:**
- Every destructive operation requires explicit confirmation and shows you exactly what will happen
- Config backup before every delete/reboot — with a one-line rollback command (and an explicit warning if a backup point can't be captured)
- Rate limiting on every mutating tool prevents runaway AI loops from flooding your firewall
- Positive input validation (IP/port/MAC/CIDR) plus path-traversal/XSS screening, and secrets redacted from logs *and* API error responses
- Wire-format verified against the pfSense REST API v2.10.0 schema by a contract-test layer, so tools send exactly what the API expects

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, pfSense with [REST API v2 package](https://github.com/pfrest/pfSense-pkg-RESTAPI) installed

**Option A — run without cloning (uvx):**

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/gensecaihq/pfsense-mcp-server pfsense-mcp-server
```

**Option B — clone for development:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gensecaihq/pfsense-mcp-server.git
cd pfsense-mcp-server
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set PFSENSE_URL, AUTH_METHOD, and credentials
```

**Connect to Claude Desktop** — add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`.

Using the installed entry point (Option A):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pfsense": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/gensecaihq/pfsense-mcp-server", "pfsense-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "PFSENSE_URL": "https://192.168.1.1",
        "AUTH_METHOD": "basic",
        "PFSENSE_USERNAME": "admin",
        "PFSENSE_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "PFSENSE_VERSION": "CE_2_8_1",
        "PFSENSE_CA_FILE": "/path/to/pfsense-ca.pem"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or running from a clone (Option B):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pfsense": {
      "command": "python3.11",
      "args": ["-m", "src.main"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/pfsense-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "PFSENSE_URL": "https://192.168.1.1",
        "AUTH_METHOD": "basic",
        "PFSENSE_USERNAME": "admin",
        "PFSENSE_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "PFSENSE_VERSION": "CE_2_8_1",
        "PFSENSE_CA_FILE": "/path/to/pfsense-ca.pem"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**About that CA file.** pfSense ships with a self-signed certificate from its own
CA, and Python does not read your OS trust store — so verification fails out of
the box. Export the CA at **System > Cert. Manager > CAs** (the export-certificate
icon), save the PEM anywhere readable, and point `PFSENSE_CA_FILE` at it. A
missing or unparseable file is a startup error, never a silent downgrade.

`VERIFY_SSL=false` also connects, and is fine for a throwaway lab. Understand what
it costs: nothing authenticates the firewall, so anything that can intercept the
connection can read the API key and act as the firewall. This tool changes
firewall rules — treat that credential accordingly.

**Start talking to your firewall.** Open Claude Desktop and ask:
- *"Show me all blocked traffic in the last hour"*
- *"What services are running?"*
- *"Create a port forward for port 443 to 192.168.1.50"*
- *"Run a full system health check"*

## What You Can Do

333 tools across every major pfSense subsystem:

| Domain | Tools | What You Can Do |
|---|:---:|---|
| **Firewall Rules** | 9 | Create, update, delete, reorder rules. Bulk block IPs. View compiled pf ruleset. |
| **Aliases** | 5 | Manage host/network/port/URL aliases. Add and remove addresses. |
| **NAT** | 16 | Port forwards, outbound NAT, 1:1 NAT — full lifecycle management. |
| **VPN** | 51 | OpenVPN servers and clients, IPsec tunnels, WireGuard peers — CRUD, status, apply. |
| **Routing** | 16 | Gateways, gateway groups, static routes, default gateway management. |
| **DNS** | 24 | Unbound resolver and dnsmasq forwarder: host overrides, domain overrides, access lists. |
| **DHCP** | 17 | Leases, static mappings, address pools, custom options, server config. |
| **Certificates** | 15 | Certs, CAs, CRLs — generate, renew, export PKCS12. |
| **Users** | 12 | User accounts, groups, LDAP/RADIUS auth server config. |
| **Interfaces** | 14 | Interface config, VLANs, bridges, groups. |
| **System** | 44 | Status, settings, diagnostics, state table, config history, reboot, ping. |
| **Services** | 14 | Start/stop/restart services. NTP, cron, SSH, service watchdog. |
| **Logs** | 3 | Firewall log analysis with parsed IPv4/IPv6 filterlog data. |
| **Traffic Shaping** | 12 | Shapers, queues, and limiters for bandwidth management. |

| **Troubleshooting** | 10 | Diagnose connectivity, blocked traffic, VPN, DHCP, DNS, HA. Full health report. |
| **Packages** | 49 | HAProxy, ACME/Let's Encrypt, BIND DNS, FreeRADIUS. |
| **Utility** | 9 | HATEOAS navigation, object ID management, guardrail status. |

## Safety First

AI managing a production firewall needs guardrails. This server has 9 layers:

```
"Delete firewall rule 5"

  1. CLASSIFY    → HIGH risk (destructive)
  2. ALLOWLIST   → tool is permitted
  3. SANITIZE    → parameters clean (no injection)
  4. RATE LIMIT  → under 10 deletes/minute
  5. DRY RUN?    → user can preview first
  6. CONFIRM     → blocked until confirm=True
  7. BACKUP      → config revision captured
  8. EXECUTE     → API call made
  9. AUDIT LOG   → action recorded with redacted params

Response includes:
  "config_backup": {
    "pre_change_revision_id": 42,
    "rollback_instruction": "restore_config_backup(revision_id=42, confirm=True)"
  }
```

Every one of the 202 mutating tools carries a guardrail, enforced at registration by a meta-test so a new tool can't ship ungated: the 52 destructive (delete/reboot/halt) tools require `confirm=True`, and the other 150 (create/update/apply/manage/export/service-control) are rate-limited, audited, and allowlist-checked. Sensitive parameters (passwords, keys, PSKs, bind passwords, tokens) are redacted in the audit log **and** in echoed API error responses.

You can also:
- Pass `dry_run=True` to preview any destructive operation without executing
- Pass `verify_descr="Allow HTTPS"` to verify you're deleting the right rule (guards against ID shifts)
- Set `MCP_READ_ONLY=true` to expose only the 131 read-only tools (search, get, diagnose)
- Set `MCP_ALLOWED_TOOLS=search_firewall_rules,get_firewall_log` to restrict to specific tools

| pfSense Plus 24.11 | [v2.7.3](https://github.com/pfrest/pfSense-pkg-RESTAPI/releases/tag/v2.7.3) (legacy) | Supported |

Requires the [pfSense REST API v2 package](https://github.com/pfrest/pfSense-pkg-RESTAPI) by [jaredhendrickson13](https://github.com/jaredhendrickson13). Package v2.8.x+ ships builds only for CE 2.8.1 and Plus 25.11.1/26.03/26.03.1; v2.7.3 is the last release with builds for CE 2.8.0 and Plus 24.11/25.11.

> **Security note:** run REST API package **v2.10.0+**. It fixes a command-injection
> flaw in the interface-group endpoints
> ([GHSA-w3w4-mvcc-vmgr](https://github.com/pfrest/pfSense-pkg-RESTAPI/security/advisories/GHSA-w3w4-mvcc-vmgr))
> and adds core command auto-escaping; v2.9.0 fixed an earlier settings-sync
> privilege escalation ([GHSA-8q8g-9f77-8g8g](https://github.com/pfrest/pfSense-pkg-RESTAPI/security/advisories/GHSA-8q8g-9f77-8g8g)).
>
> v2.10.0 also marks `OpenVPNClient.auth_pass`, `User.ipsecpsk`, and
> `WireGuardPeer.presharedkey` as **sensitive**, so the API no longer returns
> them by default. This server still *sets* them normally; if a workflow needs
> to read one back, add a sensitive-field override in the REST API settings.

## Authentication

Three methods supported (configure in `.env`):

| Method | Config | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **Basic Auth** | `AUTH_METHOD=basic` + username/password | Quick setup, local users |
| **API Key** | `AUTH_METHOD=api_key` + key from System > REST API > Keys | Automation, service accounts |
| **JWT** | `AUTH_METHOD=jwt` + username/password | Short-lived tokens, auto-refresh |

## Deployment Options

**stdio** (default) — for Claude Desktop and Claude Code:
```bash
python3 -m src.main          # from a clone
pfsense-mcp-server           # via the installed console entry point (pip/uvx/pipx)
```

**HTTP** — for remote access and multi-client setups:
```bash
python3 -m src.main -t streamable-http --port 3000
```

**Docker** — hardened container with read-only filesystem:
```bash
docker compose up
```

Container security: non-root user (`mcp:1000`), read-only filesystem, all capabilities dropped, `noexec` tmpfs, `no-new-privileges`. In HTTP mode the container health check probes an unauthenticated `/health` endpoint (the `/mcp` endpoint requires a bearer token).

**Behind an MCP gateway** — the HTTP transport is a spec-compliant Streamable
HTTP endpoint with bearer-token auth, so it can be registered as an MCP-server
target behind managed gateways such as
[AWS Bedrock AgentCore Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-target-MCPservers.html)
(use its API-key credential provider to supply the `MCP_API_KEY` bearer token,
and add the gateway's origin to `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`). Such gateways add
centralized OAuth/IAM in front and translate between protocol revisions,
including 2026-07-28. No gateway is required — this is purely an option for
environments that already run one.

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| `PFSENSE_URL` | Yes | — | pfSense URL (e.g., `https://192.168.1.1`) |
| `AUTH_METHOD` | | `api_key` | `api_key`, `basic`, or `jwt` |
| `PFSENSE_API_KEY` | * | — | REST API key |
| `PFSENSE_USERNAME` | * | — | pfSense username (for basic/jwt) |
| `PFSENSE_PASSWORD` | * | — | pfSense password (for basic/jwt) |

</details>

## Testing

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v          # 572 tests
python3 -m pytest tests/ --cov=src   # with coverage (~48%)
```

The suite includes a **wire-contract layer** (`tests/contract/`) that asserts every tool's payload against the real pfSense REST API v2.10.0 schema (distilled from the upstream OpenAPI spec), so a wrong field name or type is a failing test rather than a silent misconfiguration. CI runs on Python 3.11/3.12/3.13 with `pip-audit` dependency scanning.

On top of the in-process suite, an **end-to-end protocol smoke test** drives the
server over the real MCP wire protocol with the official
[MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) CLI — on
both transports, in CI on every push:

```bash
make test-e2e            # or: ./scripts/inspector_smoke.sh  (needs node/npx, jq)
```

It verifies the initialize handshake, the 333-tool listing with annotations,
the guardrail confirm-gate over the wire, read-only mode, and HTTP bearer-auth
plus Origin enforcement — no pfSense instance required.

## MCP Specification Compliance

Compliant with [MCP 2025-11-25](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25) — the newest revision with stable SDK support — and negotiates down to older revisions per connection, so existing clients keep working:

- `ToolAnnotations` on all 333 tools (readOnlyHint, destructiveHint, idempotentHint)
- `serverInfo.version` and `instructions` provided
- Origin header validation (MUST requirement)
- Bearer token auth with timing-safe comparison
- Default bind to localhost per spec SHOULD
- stdio and Streamable HTTP transports

### The stateless 2026-07-28 revision

The newest revision, [MCP 2026-07-28](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog) (published 28 July 2026), is the protocol's largest overhaul yet: it removes the `initialize` handshake and protocol-level sessions entirely — every request is self-contained, so remote MCP servers become ordinary stateless HTTPS endpoints — and adds an official extensions system, tighter OAuth 2.0/OIDC alignment, and a formal feature-lifecycle policy with a minimum twelve-month deprecation window.

SDK support ships in fastmcp 4, currently in beta. This codebase is **verified ready**: the full test suite **and** the MCP Inspector wire-protocol smoke test pass on the fastmcp 4 beta (4.0.0b2 / mcp SDK 2.0, checked continuously by a non-blocking CI job), the server holds no session state by design, and it uses none of the features 2026-07-28 deprecates (Roots, Sampling, MCP Logging). Adopting the stateless protocol when fastmcp 4 is stable is a dependency-pin change; fastmcp 4 servers negotiate the protocol era per connection, keeping today's handshake-era clients fully supported.
