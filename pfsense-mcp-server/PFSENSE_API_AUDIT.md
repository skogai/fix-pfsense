# pfSense REST API v2 Audit

**Version**: pfSense MCP Server v1.0.0
**API**: pfSense REST API v2.7.3 (pfrest/pfSense-pkg-RESTAPI)
**Audit Date**: March 2026
**Method**: Verified against the pfSense REST API v2 PHP source code (Endpoint.inc, ContentHandler, model files)

> **Note (2026-08):** this document is a **v1.0.0 audit snapshot**. The
> compatibility target is now pkg-RESTAPI **v2.10.0** (see README). A
> subsequent contract-driven audit (`RELEASE_AUDIT.md`) found and fixed a
> number of wire-format issues this document predates — the corrected field
> names/types are tracked in `CHANGELOG.md` and enforced by the vendored
> contract in `tests/contract/`.

## Critical API Behaviors Verified

### Control Parameters in JSON Body

The pfSense API reads `apply`, `placement`, `append`, and `remove` from the JSON request body (`$this->request_data`), NOT from URL query parameters. This server correctly merges them into the body with proper type conversion (strings to booleans/integers).

### Content-Type Header

GET requests and bodyless DELETE requests must NOT send `Content-Type: application/json`. When present, the pfSense `JSONContentHandler` is selected and query string parameters are ignored. This server omits the header on GET and bodyless DELETE.

### Endpoint Plural/Singular Pattern

- GET (list many): plural path (`/firewall/rules`, `/firewall/aliases`)
- POST/PATCH/DELETE (single item): singular path (`/firewall/rule`, `/firewall/alias`)

### DELETE Requires ID in Body

DELETE requests send the object ID in the JSON body, not in the URL path.

### Firewall Rule Interface Field

Firewall rules use `many=true` for the `interface` field, so it must be an array: `["wan"]`. NAT port forwards use `many=false`, so interface is a plain string: `"wan"`.

### Service Control Requires Numeric ID

The `POST /status/service` endpoint requires the service's integer `id` (array index), not the `name` field (which is read-only). This server looks up the ID by name before sending the control request, and reports available service names on lookup failure.

### Sort Order Constants

Sort order values must be PHP constant names: `SORT_ASC` and `SORT_DESC` (resolved by `constant()` on the server side).

### Firewall Log Model

The `FirewallLog` model only has a single `text` field containing the raw log line. Per-field filters like `action`, `src_ip`, `dst_ip` do not exist as model fields. This server uses `text__contains` for server-side text matching, then parses the filterlog CSV format by field position for structured client-side filtering (IPv4 and IPv6). Extracted IPs are validated via Python's `ipaddress` module.

### Log Line Limits

Log retrieval is capped at 50 lines per request to prevent pfSense PHP memory exhaustion (the PHP process typically has ~536MB limit).

### ARP Table Field Names

The ARP table model uses `ip_address` and `mac_address` as field names (not `ip` and `mac`). The internal names in the PHP config are `ip-address` and `mac-address` (with dashes), but the API representation uses underscores.

### JWT Authentication

The `/auth/jwt` endpoint only accepts `BasicAuth`. Credentials must be sent via `Authorization: Basic <base64>` header, not in the JSON body. The token is validated after retrieval — if the response lacks a valid token, a clear error is raised instead of sending `"Bearer None"`.

### HATEOAS

HATEOAS is a global API setting stored in config, not a per-request toggle. The per-request `?hateoas=true` query parameter is not read by the API. This server correctly uses `PATCH /system/restapi/settings` to enable/disable HATEOAS, and does not inject per-request query parameters.

### Pagination Safety

Pagination offset is capped at 100,000 (page 500 × 200 per page) to prevent pfSense PHP memory exhaustion from extreme offset values.

### Object ID Instability

pfSense uses non-persistent array indices as object IDs. After any deletion, all subsequent IDs shift. This server provides:
- `verify_object_id()` — cross-checks an ID against a stable field before operating
- `verify_descr` parameter on firewall rule update/delete
- `refresh_object_ids()` and `find_object_by_field()` utility tools

## Safety Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Confirm gates | All destructive operations require `confirm=True` |
| Stale-ID guard | Optional `verify_descr` on update/delete to prevent wrong-object operations |
| Rollback | Rule create+move failure triggers automatic cleanup deletion |
| Bulk warnings | Apply failure on bulk operations reports pending rule IDs |
| Input validation | Port, IP, MAC, alias name/type/content, description length, log type |
| Command allowlist | Diagnostic commands restricted to exact `frozenset` match |
| Path traversal prevention | Log types allowlisted, endpoint paths prefix-validated |
| Timing-safe auth | HTTP transport bearer token uses `hmac.compare_digest` |
| Configurable timeout | `API_TIMEOUT` env var (default 30s) for slow operations |
| Connection diagnostics | Startup test reports specific error: 401/403/404/SSL/timeout/network |
| Version validation | Unrecognized `PFSENSE_VERSION` causes startup error (not silent default) |
